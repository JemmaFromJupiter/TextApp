## MY PROCESS ##
The first thing I did when I started this project was create a basic layout that I used to stylise and format the layout of the entire application. Starting on the application, I created a base class called "App" which I used as the parent for all of the applications windows. It holds the base dunder init and the base make_window function that is used to display the given layout on the window.
The next step in creation was to create the basic layout for the application. I did this by creating a new file called "default_layouts" this is used to avoid the reuse of already used layers, and it allows for the constant updating of the applications display.
